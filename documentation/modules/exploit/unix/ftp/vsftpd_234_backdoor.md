## Vulnerable Application

Instructions to get the vulnerable application. If applicable, include links to the vulnerable install
files, as well as instructions on installing/configuring the environment if it is different than a
standard install. Much of this will come from the PR, and can be copy/pasted.

We'll downloaded the real file from https://security.appspot.com/downloads/vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz then apply the patch to revert it to a vuln state.

```
cd ~
wget https://security.appspot.com/downloads/vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz
tar -zxf vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz
wget https://pastebin.com/raw/AetT9sS5
echo -e "\n" >> AetT9sS5 # fixes 'patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line'
patch -s -p0 -R < AetT9sS5
```

As per the instructions on https://github.com/vvord/Palaios/blob/master/notes_on_vsftpd_compilation_and_installation_in_ubuntu_12.04.md
you'll need to edit the `Makefile` file to compile to add `-lcrypt -lpam`:
```LIBS = `./vsf_findlibs.sh` -lcrypt -lpam```

Now the normal `make`/`make install`

Now add or edit the following lines to `vsftpd.conf`:

```
ftp_username=nobody
local_enable=YES
```

Finally create the root folder:

`sudo mkdir /usr/share/empty`

You'll now need to re-own the config `sudo chown root vsftpd.conf` and start the server `sudo vsftpd ~/vsftpd-2.3.4/vsftpd.conf`.

## Verification Steps

1. Install the application
1. Start msfconsole
1. Do: `use [module path]`
1. Do: `run`
1. You should get a shell.

## Options
List each option and how to use it.

### Option Name

Talk about what it does, and how to use it appropriately. If the default value is likely to change, include the default value here.

## Scenarios
Specific demo of using the module that might be useful in a real world scenario.

### Version and OS

```
code or console output
```

For example:

To do this specific thing, here's how you do it:

```
msf > use module_name
msf auxiliary(module_name) > set POWERLEVEL >9000
msf auxiliary(module_name) > exploit
```
